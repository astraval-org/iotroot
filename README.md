# IoTRoot – IoT Ecosystem Management Platform

## 1. Overview

IoTRoot is an end-to-end IoT ecosystem management platform that enables developers, businesses, and enterprises to provision, manage, and control IoT devices securely. The platform provides real-time communication, automation, and analytics across edge and cloud.

---

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 Device View

* **Device Registry** – Unique identity for each device.
* **Thing Abstraction** – Logical representation of physical devices.
* **Codebase & OTA** – Remote firmware updates (OTA).
* **Device Provisioning** – Onboarding flow (QR, Token, Pre-shared key).
* **Device Management** – Health, status, metrics, and lifecycle management.

### 2.2 Communication

* **Persistent**: MQTT

  * Publish Only
  * Subscribe Only
  * Pub/Sub (Two-way)
* **Non-Persistent**: REST APIs

  * Send Only
  * Receive Only
  * Full Duplex

### 2.3 Security

* **Device Authentication** – TLS + Certificates / Token-based.
* **App Authentication** – OAuth2 / JWT-based access.
* **Topic-level Access Control** – Ensure devices/apps only access authorized topics.

### 2.4 Automation

* **Schedules** – Time-based tasks.
* **Triggers** – Event-based workflows.
* **Alerts & Notifications** – Email, SMS, Push, Webhooks.

### 2.5 Data Layer

* **Device Shadow** – Last reported state.
* **Device Twin** – Sync between cloud & edge shadow.
* **Data Collection** – Timeseries data ingestion, storage, query APIs.

### 2.6 Control

* **Edge Control** – Local rule engine, offline-first.
* **Cloud Control** – Centralized orchestration.

### 2.7 AI & ML

* **Edge ML** – Lightweight models (TensorFlow Lite, Edge Impulse).
* **Cloud ML** – Training & inference pipelines on collected IoT data.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 High-Level Flow

1. **Device → Broker (MQTT)** → Backend → DB → React Frontend.
2. **Frontend → Backend → Broker → Device** (control channel).
3. **Triggers/Schedulers** run inside backend and push to broker.
4. **Data Storage** in MongoDB / TimescaleDB for time-series.

### 3.2 Components

* **Broker**: VerneMQ (secure MQTT).
* **Backend**: Spring Boot (REST, Auth, Orchestration).
* **Frontend**: React (real-time updates via WebSocket/MQTT bridge).
* **Database**: MongoDB (device/twin), Timescale/Postgres (time-series).
* **Edge Agent**: Lightweight client (ESP32, Linux gateway) (in feature).
* **AI/ML**: Cloud (Python pipelines) + Edge (TensorFlow Lite) (in feature).

---

## 4. MVP Scope (Phase 1)

* Device Registry & Provisioning
* Secure MQTT + REST APIs
* Auth user and topic through server.
* Basic Automation (Triggers, Alerts)
* OTA Update (ESP32 Demo)
* React Dashboard (Real-time device data + control)

---

## 5. Security Model
* Device Shadow & Twin.
* Email, push noticication.
* TLS-secured MQTT with per-device certificates.
* OAuth2/JWT for users and applications.
* Role-based Access (Admin, Developer, Operator).
* Topic ACLs to isolate tenant data.

---

## 6. Future Roadmap

* Edge computing gateways with AI inference.
* Low-code workflow builder for automation.
* Marketplace for device templates & OTA firmware.
